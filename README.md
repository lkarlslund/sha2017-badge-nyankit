SHA2017 Badge Nyan Kit Laser Cutting files and instructions

Here is a couple of different designs for enhancing your SHA2017 badge.

You need 18 RGBs mounted on 4mm strip. You can get this at AliExpress, search for "4mm LED strip SK6812 3535". You need the one with 60LED/meter.

Instructions:
- cut one of the large LED shrouds and the "small parts" file
- tap the 5 small holes with a 3mm machine screw tap
- remove the adhesive backing from the LED strip, and cut it in small pieces, and put it on the front of the LED strip between the LEDs.
- I suggest starting the LED strip in the upper right corner, when viewing the badge from the front

Connect the LED strip like this:

GND -> pin1 of ecpantion header
5V -> pin2 of expansion header
Data In -> pin8 of expansion header

Download the NyanKit egg and have fun.
